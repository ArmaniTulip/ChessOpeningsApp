            Text="The Philidor Defense is a solid but somewhat passive opening for Black.
With 2...d6, Black secures their e5 pawn and opens a diagonal for their
light-square bishop, at the cost of blocking in the other bishop. The
Philidor is popular at lower ratings, but rarely played among masters."
