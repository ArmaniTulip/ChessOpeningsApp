            Text="The King's Gambit is one of the oldest and heavily-theorized gambits
available for White. If Black accepts the gambit, White will usually
develop their kingside with an Italian-like setup and target Black's weak
f7 pawn. The King's Gambit enjoys the most popularity among
amateur-level players, where Black is less likely to know the theory."
